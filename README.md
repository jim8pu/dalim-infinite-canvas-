Right now I'm doing a major shift which is I'm moving completely from canvas 2d to webgpu cause I really really hate lags I don't like them for that it is taking me so long to update anything cause nothing really good still working and trying to figure out things although I know no body is here it is just ans messeage for the future people.

At least for now I'm gonna call it `Dalim` its cool name.

Thank fo you reading.
